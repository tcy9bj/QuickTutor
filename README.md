How do I submit a request for a tutor’s help?
On the Home page, view the active tutor’s list for available tutors. Select the tutor’s name and this will redirect you to their Profile page. On the right side of their profile page there is a “Request as Tutor” option. Select this and fill out the relevant information per your academic needs, then click “Submit Question” to send your request.

Where do I view my requests?
Go to the Requests tab on the menu bar. Here you can view and manage your Outgoing Tutor Requests, Incoming Tutor Requests, and Current Client. 

How do I cancel my request for a tutor?
Go to the “Requests” tab on the menu bar. Under the “Outgoing Tutor Requests” find the tutor request you wish to select. Click view details for the desired tutor request then select cancel request. This request will then be removed from your “Outgoing Tutor Requests” list.

Can I submit multiple requests to various tutors?
Yes, definitely. We understand students inquire for help on the same or different questions. Once a tutor has helped you, we highly encourage you to delete your tutor requests for the same question. This is so that tutors can proceed to help other students! 

Why do I have to select a location to mark myself as an active tutor? 
We encourage tutors to choose a location so that students can request tutors that are nearby them for quicker response time. QuickTutor strives to offer quick peer-to-peer academic help and does this by limiting the wait time and/or travel time. Although it is not required to meet with tutors who are in the same building, we trust all users will uphold safety practices. 

Why can’t I see myself as an active tutor?
The active tutor lists shows other active tutors in your community who are available to help you and/or other students. You do not see yourself on the active tutor’s list because you cannot request yourself as a tutor.  You will, however, show up as an active tutor for other users. To see if you are marked as active, check the Home page under “Current Tutor Status” or go to your Profile page and check your “status” information there.
